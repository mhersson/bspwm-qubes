The download_and_build script downloads all dependencies needed to build rpms
for
    - bspwm
    - sxhkd
    - lemonbar-xft
    - sutils
    - xtitle

The bash script sets the version numbers in the .spec files, so don't change
the version numbers in the .spec file. They will be overwritten.

After running the entire script, if all is successful, one should have a
dist.tar.gz file that contains rpms for all the above mentioned packages.

Copy dist.tar.gz to dom0 and install with rpm -Uvh <package>.rpm
You may need to install libxcb, xcb-util, xcb-util-wm, libXft, libX11,
xcb-util-keysyms if they are not already on your system
